## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Databases**: MySQL (for relational data), MongoDB (for unstructured media data)
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) via Passport.js
- **Caching**: Redis for caching frequently accessed content
- **ORM/ODM**: Sequelize (MySQL), Mongoose (MongoDB)
- **Deployment**: Handled by Vercel
- **Environment Management**: Dotenv
- **Logging**: Winston for structured logging
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest

## Features

- **Event Listings**: Discover and filter Japanese cultural events, from anime conventions to traditional festivals.
- **Media Library**: Browse and search a diverse collection of anime, movies, and books related to Japanese culture.
- **User Accounts**: Register, log in, and manage user profiles.
- **Bookmarks & Reviews**: Bookmark favorite events or media items, rate, and leave reviews.
- **Search & Filter**: Advanced search and filtering options for both events and media.
- **Admin Controls**: Admin-only endpoints for managing events and media items.
- **Real-Time Updates**: WebSockets for live notifications of new events or media.

## Getting Started

### Environment Variables

This project uses a `.env` file to configure essential environment variables. Ensure the following values are set:

```plaintext
# Database Configuration
DB_HOST=sql12.freemysqlhosting.net
DB_NAME=sql12742813
DB_USERNAME=sql12742813
DB_PASSWORD=checkEmailOnDate5thNov
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DIALECT=mysql

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/japanese_culture
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=development 
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/japanese-culture-platform.git
   cd japanese-culture-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Database Setup

1. **MySQL**: Configure your MySQL database with the schema found in `database/schema.sql`. This file includes the tables for Users, Events, and Reviews.

2. **MongoDB**: Connect to MongoDB, where the `Media` collection will automatically initialize with schema validation for media types (anime, movie, book).

### Running the Application

Start the app in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Documentation

### User Endpoints

- **POST** `/api/users/register` - Register a new user
- **POST** `/api/users/login` - Log in and receive a JWT

### Event Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/events` - List all events
- **POST** `/api/events` - Create a new event (admin only)
- **GET** `/api/events/:id` - View event details

### Media Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/media` - List all media items
- **POST** `/api/media` - Add new media item (admin only)
- **GET** `/api/media/:id` - View media details

---

## Production Considerations

### 1. **Error Handling**

   The application uses a global error handler in `middlewares/errorHandler.js` to manage all unexpected exceptions, ensuring a smooth user experience even when errors occur. Validation checks are embedded in each controller to catch errors early.

### 2. **Logging**

   Winston is used for structured logging. Logs are set up to capture all HTTP requests and application errors with different levels (info, warning, error). Log rotation is configured to keep the log files manageable.

### 3. **Caching**

   Redis is implemented to cache frequently accessed event and media data, reducing the load on MySQL and MongoDB. Caching middleware is applied to endpoints that list events and media items.

### 4. **Security**

   - **Helmet** is used for securing HTTP headers.
   - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, and JWTs are used for authentication.
   - Rate limiting on sensitive routes prevents abuse.
   - Environment variables are securely managed with dotenv.


## Advanced Features

1. **Rate Limiting**: Configured with `express-rate-limit` to handle potential abuse of login and registration routes.
2. **WebSockets**: Real-time notifications for newly added events or media. Clients are notified when new events or media are published.
3. **Database Indexing**: Indexes set in MySQL for frequently queried columns and in MongoDB for fields like `type` and `genre` to optimize query performance.
4. **Scalability**: Check this
5. **Automated Testing**: CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions runs Jest and Supertest for automated testing on all pull requests.

## Testing

Jest and Supertest provide robust unit and integration tests, covering key functionalities such as authentication, CRUD operations, and error handling. Tests are located in the `/tests` directory and can be run with:

```bash
npm test
```
